# Introduction
My idea for a game was to have a road with 5 lanes on it.  The player controls a car on the bottom of the screen with the buttons.  The 1st and 4th button changes lane, the 3rd button will increase speed, and the 2nd button decreases speed.  The game will randomly place obstacles on the road that the player has to avoid with their car.  If the player hits an obstacle the game is over.
